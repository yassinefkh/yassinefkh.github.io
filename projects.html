            <h2>Recognition of Spatial Relations in a Linguistic Perspective</h2>
            <p class="project-date">2024 – 2025</p>
            <p class="description">
                Study and research project carried out during the first year of the VMI Master's program at Université Paris Cité (2024-2025), supervised by Logan Servant, Camille Kurtz, and Laurent Wendling.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                This project focuses on the recognition of spatial relations between objects in images, according to linguistic frames of reference. While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have achieved remarkable performance in various tasks, they still struggle to accurately capture spatial reasoning and relative object positions.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                The goal is to study and model how spatial relations are described from different linguistic perspectives: relative (egocentric), intrinsic, and absolute references. The project includes the implementation of a neural model for identifying egocentric relations, and the integration of external knowledge (coordinates, depth maps) to improve recognition of exocentric relations.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                This exploratory work is based on a newly composed dataset annotated with spatial relations, aiming to bridge the gap between spatial perception and linguistic description in computer vision.

            <h2>Research Internship – Analysis of Relative Position Descriptors</h2>
            <p class="project-date">2023</p>
            <p class="description">
                Research internship carried out at the Laboratoire d’Informatique Paris Descartes (LIPADE), supervised by Camille Kurtz and Laurent Wendling.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                The internship focused on the analysis of relative position descriptors in computer vision. The main objective was to study and implement the φ-descriptor, a descriptor designed to encode spatial relations between objects in an image.
