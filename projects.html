        <h2>Research Work – Recognition of Spatial Relations in a Linguistic Perspective</h2>
        <p class="description">
            Study and research work carried out during the first year of the VMI Master's program at Université Paris Cité (2024-2025), supervised by Logan Servant, Camille Kurtz, and Laurent Wendling.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
            This project focuses on the recognition of spatial relations between objects in images, according to linguistic frames of reference. While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have achieved remarkable performance in various tasks, they still struggle to accurately capture spatial reasoning and relative object positions.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
            The goal of this research is to study and model the way spatial relations are described from different linguistic perspectives, namely relative (egocentric), intrinsic, and absolute references. The project includes the implementation of a neural model capable of identifying egocentric spatial relations, and the integration of external knowledge (such as coordinates or depth maps) to improve the recognition of exocentric relations.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
            This exploratory work is based on a newly composed dataset annotated with spatial relations, and aims to bridge the gap between spatial perception and linguistic description in computer vision.
